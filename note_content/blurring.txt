what happen in blurring:
we first care about kernel, which is a matrix which cols and rows, and in guassianblurring something heppens(blur)
to the middle pixel of the matrix by its surroundiung pixels. 

one of the technique is #Average in which we define a kernel and that kernal compute for all pixels of an image
by computing the true center value by avaergaing all the surroundiung pixels. The high kernel size, the image will
be more blur.


well, how we know which blur is good?.
for humans may be blurring not usefull but for image processing algos, it is.
