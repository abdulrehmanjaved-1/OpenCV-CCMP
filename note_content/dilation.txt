Dilation expands the white areas in an image, which is useful for thickening edges, connecting disconnected areas, and filling in small gaps or holes in detected shapes.
In your code, cv.dilate(canny, (7,7), iterations=2):
canny: The input image (edges detected by Canny).
(7,7): The kernel size, which defines the area around each pixel that will be used for dilation.
iterations=2: The number of times the dilation operation is applied, making the edges grow thicker with each iteration.
